Emotion Detection

This project is a deep learning-based emotion detection system built using Python and Gradio. It classifies facial expressions into multiple emotions using a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on FER2013Plus dataset.


* Developed an emotion detection model using CNN on Facial images.
* Implemented data preprocessing & augmentation for better model generalization.
* used pretrained Resnet50 model on greyscale images.
* Achieved validation F1 score of 0.61 and Test F1 score of 0.62 .
* Deployed the project with HuggingFace and Gradio app for interactive demonstration.
